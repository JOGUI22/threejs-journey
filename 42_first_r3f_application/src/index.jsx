If you are testing on a high pixel ratio screen or have the luxury of having multiple screens with different pixel ratios, you might notice that the renderer handles it automatically. Still, in previous lessons, we discovered that itâ€™s good practice to clamp it in order to avoid performance issues on devices with a very high pixel ratio.
